A Boot.dev guided project where I built a static site generator from scratch.

It takes raw content files (like Markdown and images) and turns them into a static website (which is a mix of HTML and CSS files).

At the moment of writing this README, it deploys to a blog page that's dedicated to Tolkien and discussions about the Lord of the Rings franchise. In the future, I will use it to publish either a personal blog or as an online portfolio.
